## INDEPENDENT STUDY – INTERACTIVE UI & GAMING-STYLE FRONTEND R&D  
**Interactive UI Engineer (Self-Directed Research & Portfolio Development)**  
*2024 – 2025 (full-time)*  

Spent a full year in focused independent study, designing and building a production-grade portfolio platform as a testbed for **gaming-style UI**, real-time reactive interfaces, and high-performance motion systems.

- Architected and implemented a full-stack interactive portfolio using React, TypeScript, Next.js, Payload CMS, Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions, and AWS (including S3-backed media and environment-specific deployments).  
- Built game-like UI systems: parallax project carousel with swipe navigation, an animated grid with simulated depth (“Fluxel”), a physics-driven kinetic orb, sprite-sheet rendering pipelines, and HUD-style panels with layered motion and stateful transitions.   
- Engineered a CMS-backed content model for projects and case studies: dynamic routing/slug generation, NDA-aware content gating, responsive image pipelines, and SSR/SSG configurations tuned for performance.  
- Implemented production-grade tooling and DX: strict TypeScript type safety across frontend and backend, unified linting/formatting, reusable component systems, and automated CI/CD workflows for repeatable deployments.  
- Instrumented UI performance/engagement with custom FPS counters, Segment + GA4 funnels, and build-time Core Web Vitals budgets to guide polish work.  
- Sustained a disciplined R&D cadence with 2,800+ commits of iterative work spanning animation architecture, interaction design, visual polish, and infrastructure automation.  
- Currently applying final visual, UX, and content polish and will be sharing the live interactive portfolio as the primary showcase of gaming-style UI and frontend engineering work.
